Allows you send anonymous messages to your friends without them
knowing who sent it.

This is my first project on php; At this point I haven't learnt 
SQL so the database is based on XML and XML DOM manipulations with PHP DOM
That's,the HTML structured is built and altered from the backend before sent to the frontend
Unlike the other anonymous message website(the other repo) that uses JS DOM by manipulating the browser's virtual DOM

It has a register page(index.php);
A login page;
A page that display each users messages (l.php)
A password reset php script is also implemented.(In future commits,I removed 
the encryption key)
